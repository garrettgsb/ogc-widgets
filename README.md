# Off-Grid Customs Widgets

This App is meant as a testing and implimitation project to try-out looks, features, and ideas that will go on to be integrated in the main app.

## Enviornment Variables

This project requires the following environment variables:

**REACT_APP_SHEET_URL** - This is the URL for the Google Sheet that you want to load. It should look something like this:

```
https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/1VWHtnA9OfngQFhVVsZHrZpPOxibFFzISchcN3l9pPDE/values/Data
```

Where the big long ID corresponds to the normal ID in the URL of the document, and `Data` corresponds to the specific
sheet or range within that document that you want to load.

**REACT_APP_SHEET_API_KEY** - This is the API key created/obtained from here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
(If you don't have one, click "+ Create Credentials" in the top bar, then "API key." You don't need to do anything with OAuth to make this work.)

**Activate Google Sheets API** - Remember to activate the Sheets API or you will get a 403 - Permission Denied error. Follow the steps here: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project once the project and API key are created.
